**skuba** is a toolkit for backend application and package development on SEEK's gravel and paved roads:

- Write in [TypeScript]
- Enforce coding standards with [ESLint] and [Prettier]
- Test with [Jest]
- Deploy with [Gantry], [Serverless] or the [AWS CDK]

[aws cdk]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/work-with-cdk-typescript.html
[gantry]: https://gantry.ssod.skinfra.xyz
[serverless]: https://serverless.com/

It provides you with:

- [CLI] commands for developing your project
- [Templates] to base your backend application or package on
- [Development] and optional [runtime] APIs for cross-cutting concerns

Learn more [about](docs/about.md) **skuba** and [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) to it.

---

**skuba** is distributed as an npm package.

In projects that list it as a `devDependency`,
usage may look something like this:

```shell
# Install project dependencies.
yarn

# Run the skuba CLI.
yarn skuba help
```

Global installations are also supported to speed up local development:

```shell
# Install skuba globally.
yarn global add skuba

# Look, no `npx`!
skuba help
```
