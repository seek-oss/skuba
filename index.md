**skuba** is a toolkit for backend application and package development on SEEK's gravel and paved roads:

- Write in TypeScript
- Enforce coding standards with ESLint and Prettier
- Test with Jest
- Deploy with [Gantry], [Serverless] or the [AWS CDK]

[aws cdk]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/work-with-cdk-typescript.html
[gantry]: https://gantry.ssod.skinfra.xyz
[serverless]: https://serverless.com/

It provides you with:

- Commands for developing your project
- Templates to base your backend application or package on

---

## Getting started

Create a new project:

```shell
npx skuba init
```

Or bootstrap an existing project:

```shell
npx skuba configure
```

Global installations are supported to speed up local development:

```shell
yarn global add skuba

# Look, no `npx`!
skuba version
```
