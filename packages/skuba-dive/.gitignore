# Ignore .npmrc. This is no longer managed by skuba as pnpm projects use a managed .npmrc.
# IMPORTANT: if migrating to pnpm, remove this line and add an .npmrc IN THE SAME COMMIT.
# You can use `skuba format` to generate the file or otherwise commit an empty file.
# Doing so will conflict with a local .npmrc and make it more difficult to unintentionally commit auth secrets.
