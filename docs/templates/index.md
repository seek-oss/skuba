# Templates

---

**skuba** allows you to initialise a new project from a variety of templates.

[Barebones] templates can be used for proof-of-concepts, scripts, or anything outside of the ordinary.
The other built-in templates represent starting points for the typical kinds of projects you'll build at SEEK,
including backend components such as [APIs] and [workers],
and npm [packages] for sharing code across components.

You can also define and [bring your own] externally-hosted template.

[apis]: ./api.md
[barebones]: ./barebones.md
[bring your own]: ./byo.md
[packages]: ./package.md
[workers]: ./worker.md
