# Templates

---

**skuba** allows you to initialise a new project from a variety of templates.

The built-in options represent starting points for the typical kinds of projects you'll see at SEEK,
include backend components such as [APIs] and [workers],
and npm packages for sharing code across other components.

You can also define and [bring your own] externally-hosted template.

[apis]: ./api.md
[bring your own]: ./byo.md
[packages]: ./package.md
[workers]: ./worker.md
