# Worker

## lambda-sqs-worker

An asynchronous [worker] built on [AWS Lambda] and deployed with [Serverless].

Modelled after the "enricher" pattern where an event is received from a source SNS topic and a corresponding enrichment is published to a destination SNS topic.
For fault tolerance,
a message queue is employed between the source topic and the Lambda function,
and unprocessed events are sent to a dead-letter queue for manual triage.
