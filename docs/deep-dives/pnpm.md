# pnpm

---

[pnpm] is the recommended package manager of choice for TypeScript projects at SEEK.

This topic details how to use pnpm with **skuba**.

---

## Background

**skuba** serves as a wrapper for numerous developer tools such as TypeScript, Jest, Prettier & ESLint,
abstracting the dependency management of those packages across SEEK projects.
When you are using **skuba**,
you do not need to declare these packages as direct `devDependencies`.
In our previously-recommended package manager, [Yarn], these packages and others are automatically hoisted to create a flattened dependency tree.

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "skuba": "7.2.0"
  }
}
```

```console
node_modules
â”œâ”€â”€ jest
â”œâ”€â”€ prettier
â”œâ”€â”€ skuba
â””â”€â”€ other-skuba-deps
```

However, this behaviour can lead to some [silly bugs] when updating packages.

### pnpm in skuba

pnpm addresses the hoisting issue with a [symlinked structure].
Each package is guaranteed to resolve compatible versions of its dependencies, rather than whichever versions were incidentally hoisted.

This behaviour is a double-edged sword for a toolkit like **skuba**.
Dependencies like Prettier and ESLint end up nested in a `node_modules/skuba/node_modules` subdirectory,
where most editor and developer tooling integrations will not know to look.

```console
node_modules
â”œâ”€â”€ skuba -> ./.pnpm/skuba@7.2.0
â””â”€â”€ .pnpm
    â”œâ”€â”€ skuba@7.2.0
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ node_modules
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ prettier -> ../../prettier@3.0.0
    â””â”€â”€ prettier@3.0.0
        â””â”€â”€ node_modules
            â””â”€â”€ other-dep -> <store>/other-dep
```

### .npmrc

pnpm allows us to specify dependencies to hoist via command line or [`.npmrc`].
The number of package patterns we need to hoist may fluctuate over time,
so specifying hoist patterns via command line would be difficult to maintain.

The **skuba**-maintained `.npmrc` currently instructs pnpm to hoist the following dependencies:

```shell
# managed by skuba
public-hoist-pattern[]="@types*"
public-hoist-pattern[]="*eslint*"
public-hoist-pattern[]="*prettier*"
public-hoist-pattern[]="esbuild"
public-hoist-pattern[]="jest"
public-hoist-pattern[]="tsconfig-seek"
# end managed by skuba
```

From the previous example, this will produce the following `node_modules` layout,
allowing external integrations to find `prettier` in `node_modules/prettier` as before.

```console
node_modules
â”œâ”€â”€ prettier -> ./.pnpm/prettier@3.0.0
â”œâ”€â”€ skuba -> ./.pnpm/skuba@7.2.0
â””â”€â”€ .pnpm
    â”œâ”€â”€ skuba@7.2.0
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ node_modules
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ prettier -> ../../prettier@3.0.0
    â””â”€â”€ prettier@3.0.0
        â””â”€â”€ node_modules
            â””â”€â”€ other-dep -> <store>/other-dep
```

Committing pnpm configuration in `.npmrc` can conflict with build pipelines that synthesise an ephemeral `.npmrc` to access private SEEK packages on the npm registry.
A solution to this problem is detailed in the migration guide below.

---

## Migrating from Yarn 1.x to pnpm

This migration guide assumes that your project was scaffolded with a **skuba** template.

1. Install **skuba** 7.4.0 or greater

2. Install pnpm

   Run the following on macOS:

   ```bash
   brew install pnpm
   ```

   (Check the [install guide] for other operating systems.)

3. Add a `packageManager` key to `package.json`

   ```json
   "packageManager": "pnpm@9.0.5",
   ```

4. Create [`pnpm-workspace.yaml`](https://pnpm.io/pnpm-workspace_yaml)

   Skip this step if your project does not use Yarn workspaces.

   ```yaml
   packages:
     # all packages in direct subdirectories of packages/
     - 'packages/*'
   ```

   (Optional) If your sub-package `package.json`s reference one another using the syntax `foo: *`,
   you can replace these references with the [workspace protocol] using the syntax `foo: workspace:*`.

5. Run `pnpm import && rm yarn.lock`

   This converts `yarn.lock` to `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

6. Run `pnpm skuba format`

   This will synthesise managed hoist patterns into `.npmrc`.

7. Include additional hoisting settings in `.npmrc`

   Skip this step if your project does not use Serverless.

   ```diff
   # managed by skuba
   public-hoist-pattern[]="@types*"
   public-hoist-pattern[]="*eslint*"
   public-hoist-pattern[]="*prettier*"
   public-hoist-pattern[]="esbuild"
   public-hoist-pattern[]="jest"
   public-hoist-pattern[]="tsconfig-seek"
   # end managed by skuba
   +
   + # Required for Serverless packaging
   + node-linker=hoisted
   + shamefully-hoist=true
   ```

8. Remove the `.npmrc` ignore entry from `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore`

   Heed the warning and ensure that a safe `.npmrc` is included in the same commit.

   ```diff
   yarn-error.log
   # end managed by skuba
   -
   - # Ignore .npmrc. This is no longer managed by skuba as pnpm projects use a managed .npmrc.
   - # IMPORTANT: if migrating to pnpm, remove this line and add an .npmrc IN THE SAME COMMIT.
   - # You can use `skuba format` to generate the file or otherwise commit an empty file.
   - # Doing so will conflict with a local .npmrc and make it more difficult to unintentionally commit auth secrets.
   - .npmrc
   ```

9. Run `rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install`

   This will ensure your local workspace will not have any lingering hoisted dependencies from `yarn`.

   If you have a monorepo, delete all sub-package `node_modules` directories.

10. Run `pnpm skuba lint`

    After running `pnpm install`,
    you may notice that some module imports no longer work.
    This is intended behaviour as these packages are no longer hoisted by default.
    Explicitly declare these as `dependencies` or `devDependencies` in `package.json`.

    For example:

    ```shell
    Cannot find module 'foo'. Did you mean to set the 'moduleResolution' option to 'nodenext', or to add aliases to the 'paths' option? ts(2792)
    ```

    Run `pnpm install foo` to resolve this error.

11. Modify `Dockerfile` or `Dockerfile.dev-deps`

    Your build pipeline may have previously mounted an ephemeral `.npmrc` with an auth token at `/workdir`.
    This needs to be mounted elsewhere to avoid overwriting the new pnpm configuration stored in `.npmrc`.

    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    ```diff
      FROM --platform=arm64 node:20-alpine AS dev-deps
    
    + RUN --mount=type=bind,source=package.json,target=package.json \
    + corepack enable pnpm && corepack install
    
    + RUN pnpm config set store-dir /root/.pnpm-store
    
      WORKDIR /workdir
    
    - COPY package.json yarn.lock ./
    - COPY packages/foo/package.json packages/foo/
    
    - RUN --mount=type=secret,id=npm,dst=/workdir/.npmrc \
    -     yarn install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-optional --non-interactive
    + RUN --mount=type=bind,source=.npmrc,target=.npmrc \
    +     --mount=type=bind,source=pnpm-lock.yaml,target=pnpm-lock.yaml \
    +     --mount=type=secret,id=npm,dst=/root/.npmrc,required=true \
    +     pnpm fetch
    ```

    Move the `dst` of the ephemeral `.npmrc` from `/workdir/.npmrc` to `/root/.npmrc`,
    and use a [bind mount] in place of `COPY` to mount `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

    [`pnpm fetch`] does not require `package.json` to be copied to resolve packages;
    trivial updates to `package.json` like a change in `scripts` will no longer result in a cache miss.
    `pnpm fetch` is also optimised for monorepos and does away with the need to copy nested `package.json`s.
    However, this command only serves to populate a local package store and stops short of installing the packages,
    the implications of which are covered in the next step.

    Review [`Dockerfile.dev-deps`] from the new `koa-rest-api` template as a reference point.

12. Replace `yarn` with `pnpm` in `Dockerfile`

    As `pnpm fetch` does not actually install packages,
    run a subsequent `pnpm install --offline` before any command which may reference a dependency.
    Swap out `yarn` commands for `pnpm` commands,
    and drop the unnecessary `AS deps` stage.

    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    ```diff
    - FROM ${BASE_IMAGE} AS deps
    -
    - RUN yarn install --ignore-optional --ignore-scripts --non-interactive --offline --production
    -
    - ###
    -
      FROM ${BASE_IMAGE} AS build
    
      COPY . .
    
    - RUN yarn build
    + RUN pnpm install --offline
    + RUN pnpm build
    + RUN pnpm install --offline --prod
    
      ###
    
      FROM --platform=arm64 gcr.io/distroless/nodejs20-debian12 AS runtime
      WORKDIR /workdir
    
      COPY --from=build /workdir/lib lib
    -
    - COPY --from=deps /workdir/node_modules node_modules
    + COPY --from=build /workdir/node_modules node_modules
    
      ENV NODE_ENV=production
    ```

13. Modify plugins in `.buildkite/pipeline.yml`

    Your build pipeline may have previously output an ephemeral `.npmrc` with an auth token on the build agent.
    This needs to be output elsewhere to avoid overwriting the new pnpm configuration stored in `.npmrc`.

    Swap out caching on `yarn.lock` for `.npmrc` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` at the same time.

    We are also using an updated caching syntax on `package.json` which caches only on the `packageManager` key. This requires the [seek-oss/docker-ecr-cache](https://github.com/seek-oss/docker-ecr-cache-buildkite-plugin) plugin version to be >= 2.2.0.

    ```diff
      seek-oss/private-npm#v1.2.0:
        env: NPM_READ_TOKEN
    +   output-path: tmp/
    ```

    ```diff
    -Â seek-oss/docker-ecr-cache#v2.1.0:
    + seek-oss/docker-ecr-cache#v2.2.0:
        cache-on:
    +     - .npmrc
    -     - package.json
    +     - package.json#.packageManager
    -     - yarn.lock
    +     - pnpm-lock.yaml
        dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev-deps
    -   secrets: id=npm,src=.npmrc
    +   secrets: id=npm,src=tmp/.npmrc
    ```

14. Run `pnpm install --offline` and replace `yarn` with `pnpm` in `.buildkite/pipeline.yml`

    ```diff
     - label: ðŸ§ª Test & Lint
       commands:
    +    - echo '--- pnpm install --offline'
    +    - pnpm install --offline
    -    - echo '+++ yarn test:ci'
    -    - yarn test:ci
    -    - echo '--- yarn lint'
    -    - yarn lint
    +    - echo '+++ pnpm test:ci'
    +    - pnpm test:ci
    +    - echo '--- pnpm lint'
    +    - pnpm lint
    ```

    #### FAQ

    **Q:** I'm running into `ERR_PNPM_CANNOT_DEPLOYâ€‰ A deploy is only possible from inside a workspace`

    **A:** `pnpm deploy` is a reserved command. Use `pnpm run deploy` instead.

15. Search for other references to `yarn` in your project. Replace these with `pnpm` where necessary.
