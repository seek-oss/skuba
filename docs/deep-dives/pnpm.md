# pnpm

---

pnpm is the recommended package manager of choice for projects at SEEK.

This topic details how to use pnpm with **skuba**.

---

## Background

**skuba** simply serves a wrapper for numerous developer tools such as TypeScript, Jest, Prettier & ESLint,
abstracting the dependency management of those packages across SEEK projects.
This means that when you are using **skuba**,
you do not need to declare these packages as direct `devDependencies`.
In our previously-recommended package manager, [Yarn], these packages and others are automatically hoisted to create a flattened dependency tree.

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "skuba": "7.2.0"
  }
}
```

```
node_modules
â”œâ”€â”€ jest
â”œâ”€â”€ prettier
â”œâ”€â”€ skuba
â””â”€â”€ other-skuba-deps
```

However, this behaviour can lead to some [silly bugs] when updating packages.

## pnpm in skuba

[pnpm] addresses the hoisting issue by using a [symlinked structure] which allows every package to use the version range of the package they declared as opposed to the version which may have been hoisted.

This is a double-edged sword when it comes to using **skuba**,
as this means that our dependencies such as Prettier and ESLint become nested within a `node_modules/skuba/node_modules` subdirectory,
where most editor and developer tooling integrations will not know to look.

```
node_modules
â”œâ”€â”€ skuba -> ./.pnpm/skuba@7.2.0
â””â”€â”€ .pnpm
    â”œâ”€â”€ skuba@7.2.0
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ node_modules
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ prettier -> ../../prettier@3.0.0
    â””â”€â”€ prettier@3.0.0
        â””â”€â”€ node_modules
            â””â”€â”€ other-dep -> <store>/other-dep
```

#### .npmrc

pnpm allows us to specify dependencies to hoist via command line or [`.npmrc`] file.
However, the number of package patterns we need to hoist may fluctuate,
so specifying hoist patterns via command line would be difficult to maintain.

The **skuba**-maintained `.npmrc` instructs the following dependencies to be hoisted:

```
# managed by skuba
public-hoist-pattern[]="@types*"
public-hoist-pattern[]="*eslint*"
public-hoist-pattern[]="*prettier*"
public-hoist-pattern[]="esbuild"
public-hoist-pattern[]="jest"
public-hoist-pattern[]="tsconfig-seek"
# end managed by skuba
```

From the previous example, this will produce the following `node_modules` layout which means that our integrations will now be able to find `prettier` in `node_modules/prettier` like before.

```
node_modules
â”œâ”€â”€ prettier -> ./.pnpm/prettier@3.0.0
â”œâ”€â”€ skuba -> ./.pnpm/skuba@7.2.0
â””â”€â”€ .pnpm
    â”œâ”€â”€ skuba@7.2.0
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ node_modules
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ prettier -> ../../prettier@3.0.0
    â””â”€â”€ prettier@3.0.0
        â””â”€â”€ node_modules
            â””â”€â”€ other-dep -> <store>/other-dep
```

This presents challenges to build pipelines that synthesise an ephemeral `.npmrc` to access private SEEK packages on the npm registry.
We deal with this in the migration guide below.

## Migrating to pnpm from Yarn or npm

This migration guide assumes that you scaffolded your project with a **skuba** template.

1. Install **skuba** 7.4.0 or greater

2. Install pnpm

   On macOS you can run the following:

   ```bash
   brew install pnpm
   ```

   For other operating systems you can check the [install guide].

3. Add a `packageManager` key to your `package.json`

   ```json
   "packageManager": "pnpm@8.15.1",
   ```

4. Create [`pnpm-workspace.yaml`](https://pnpm.io/pnpm-workspace_yaml)

   Skip this step if your project does not use Yarn workspaces.

   ```yaml
   packages:
     # all packages in direct subdirs of packages/
     - 'packages/*'
   ```

5. Run [`pnpm import`]

   This converts your `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json` into a `pnpm-lock.yaml` file.

6. Delete the `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json` file

7. Run `skuba format`

   This will synthesise some managed hoist patterns into `.npmrc`.

8. Include additional hoisting settings into `.npmrc`

   Skip this step if your project does not use Serverless.

   ```diff
   # managed by skuba
   public-hoist-pattern[]="@types*"
   public-hoist-pattern[]="*eslint*"
   public-hoist-pattern[]="*prettier*"
   public-hoist-pattern[]="esbuild"
   public-hoist-pattern[]="jest"
   public-hoist-pattern[]="tsconfig-seek"
   # end managed by skuba
   +
   + # Required for Serverless packaging
   + node-linker=hoisted
   + shamefully-hoist=true
   ```

9. Run `pnpm i`

10. Handle transitive dependency issues

    Since installing pnpm, you may have noticed that some imports you are making in your code no longer work.
    This is an intended behaviour of pnpm as these dependencies are no longer being hoisted.
    You will now need to explicitly declare these as `dependencies` or `devDependencies` in your `package.json`.

    For example:

    ```
    Cannot find module 'foo'. Did you mean to set the 'moduleResolution' option to 'nodenext', or to add aliases to the 'paths' option? ts(2792)
    ```

    To resolve this, you would need to run `pnpm install foo`.

11. Modify your `Dockerfile` or `Dockerfile.dev-deps` file

    Your build pipeline may mount an ephemeral `.npmrc` with an auth token at `/workdir`.
    We need to mount this elsewhere now that our Git repository stores pnpm configuration in `.npmrc`.

    ```diff
      FROM --platform=${BUILDPLATFORM:-<%- platformName %>} node:20-alpine AS dev-deps

    + RUN corepack enable pnpm
    + RUN pnpm config set store-dir /root/.pnpm-store

      WORKDIR /workdir

    - COPY package.json yarn.lock ./
    - COPY packages/foo/package.json packages/foo/

    - RUN --mount=type=secret,id=npm,dst=/workdir/.npmrc \
    -     yarn install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-optional --non-interactive
    + RUN --mount=type=bind,source=pnpm-lock.yaml,target=pnpm-lock.yaml \
    +     --mount=type=secret,id=npm,dst=/root/.npmrc,required=true \
    +     pnpm fetch
    ```

    We move the `dst` of the ephemeral `.npmrc` from `/workdir/.npmrc` to `/root/.npmrc` so it does not overwrite our pnpm configuration,
    and utilise a [bind mount] instead of the `COPY` to mount the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file.

    You will notice that we are no longer copying `package.json` in the `Dockerfile`.
    [`pnpm fetch`] does not require this file to resolve packages,
    so trivial updates to the `package.json` file will no longer result in a cache miss.
    `pnpm fetch` is also optimised for monorepo setups,
    so if you were previously declaring sub-package directories in your `Dockerfile`,
    you can remove them completely.
    The usage of `pnpm fetch` does have some implications which we will cover in the next step.

    You can view [`Dockerfile.dev-deps`] from the new `koa-rest-api` template as a reference point.

13. Modify your usages of `yarn` to `pnpm` in `Dockerfile`

    Since we installed our dependencies with `pnpm fetch`, we will now also have to run a `pnpm install -offline` before any command which may call a dependency. You will also need to exchange `yarn` for `pnpm run`. We have also simplified the usage of stages by removing the `AS dep` stage.

    ```diff
      ###
    -
    - FROM ${BASE_IMAGE} AS deps
    -
    - RUN yarn install --ignore-optional --ignore-scripts --non-interactive --offline --production
    -
    - ###
    -
      FROM ${BASE_IMAGE} AS build

      COPY . .

    - RUN yarn build
    + RUN pnpm install --offline
    + RUN pnpm run build
    + RUN pnpm install --offline --prod

      ###

      FROM --platform=${BUILDPLATFORM:-<%- platformName %>} gcr.io/distroless/nodejs20-debian12 AS runtime
      WORKDIR /workdir

      COPY --from=build /workdir/lib lib

    - COPY --from=deps /workdir/node_modules node_modules
    + COPY --from=build /workdir/node_modules node_modules

      ENV NODE_ENV=production
    ```

14. Modify your `.buildkite/pipeline.yml` plugins

    As our application now contains a `.npmrc` file in our `workdir`, we now also need to also change the mount path of our auth token `.npmrc` file in our buildkite plugins. We will also be exchanging the `yarn.lock` file for `pnpm-lock.yaml`

    ```diff
      seek-oss/private-npm#v1.2.0:
        env: NPM_READ_TOKEN
    +   output-path: tmp/
    ```

    ```diff
     seek-oss/docker-ecr-cache#v2.1.0:
       cache-on:
    -    - package.json
    -    - yarn.lock
    +    - pnpm-lock.yaml
       dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev-deps
    -  secrets: id=npm,src=.npmrc
    +  secrets: id=npm,src=tmp/.npmrc
    ```

15. Modify your usages of `yarn` to `pnpm` in `.buildkite/pipeline.yml`

    ```diff
     - label: ðŸ§ª Test & Lint
       commands:
    +    - echo '--- pnpm install --offline'
    +    - pnpm install --offline
    -    - echo '+++ yarn test:ci'
    -    - yarn test:ci
    -    - echo '--- yarn lint'
    -    - yarn lint
    +    - echo '+++ pnpm run test:ci'
    +    - pnpm run test:ci
    +    - echo '--- pnpm run lint'
    +    - pnpm run lint
    ```
