**deps:** TypeScript 4.3

This major release includes breaking changes. See the [announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-3/) for more information.

To make use of new TypeScript 4.3 syntax features, you may need to regenerate your lockfile to upgrade transitive ESLint and Prettier dependencies.
