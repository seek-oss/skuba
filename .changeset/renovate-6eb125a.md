deps: semantic-release ^24.0.0

This major upgrade bumps our minimum requirement from Node.js 18.18 to 20.8.1.

If using Node.js 18, a previous release landed a [`skuba migrate`](https://seek-oss.github.io/skuba/docs/cli/migrate.html) command to simplify upgrades to Node.js 20. Node.js 18 reaches EOL in April 2025.
