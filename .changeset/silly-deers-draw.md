deps: TypeScript 4.4

This major release includes breaking changes. See the [announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-4/) for more information.

Note that new syntax in TypeScript 4.4 will only be supported by `skuba format` and `skuba lint` once ESLint v8 is released.
