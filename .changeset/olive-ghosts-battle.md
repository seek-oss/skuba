deps: eslint-config-skuba 1.0.12

This adds a couple new linting rules:

- [jest/prefer-expect-resolves](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest/blob/v25.2.2/docs/rules/prefer-expect-resolves.md)
- [jest/prefer-to-be](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest/blob/v25.2.2/docs/rules/prefer-to-be.md)

Run `skuba format` to automatically align your code with these rules.
