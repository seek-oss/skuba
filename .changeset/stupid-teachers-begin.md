template/\*: Remove `.me` files

SEEK is moving away from Codex to off-the-shelf software powered by Backstage `catalog-info.yaml` files.

At the moment we're only asking teams to document their systems, which typically span across multiple repositories. We may add `catalog-info.yaml` files back to the templates if there's a need for teams to document their components at a repository level.
