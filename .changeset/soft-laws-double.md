docs: Refresh ARM64 guide

This is not a change to skuba but rather a shameless plug for our deep-dive documentation. The [ARM64 guide](https://seek-oss.github.io/skuba/docs/deep-dives/arm64.html#migrating-an-existing-project) was just refreshed to prepare for upcoming migrations, and we also have [one for pnpm](https://seek-oss.github.io/skuba/docs/deep-dives/pnpm.html).
