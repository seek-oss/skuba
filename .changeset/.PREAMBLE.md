This major release includes [patches](https://seek-oss.github.io/skuba/docs/cli/lint.html#patches) and configuration changes to migrate TypeScript projects onto modern module patterns. It partially automates [Step 2 of our transition to ECMAScript modules](https://seek-oss.github.io/skuba/docs/deep-dives/esm.html#2-replace-skuba-diveregister-with-subpath-imports).

Changing the module patterns of your project may result in Jest and/or TypeScript errors that require manual triage. Refer to the below troubleshooting sections to begin with, and reach out in `#skuba-support` if you're stuck.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> **Test the changes in a non-production environment before deploying to production.** The automated migration cannot account for all custom deployment configurations.

If your project is not configured for [GitHub autofixes](https://seek-oss.github.io/skuba/docs/deep-dives/github.html#github-autofixes) in CI, `skuba lint` will not be able to push the patch commit.

```console
Failed to push fix commit.
Does your CI environment have write access to your Git repository?
```

You can either set up [GitHub autofixes](https://seek-oss.github.io/skuba/docs/deep-dives/github.html#github-autofixes) in CI, or run `skuba format` then commit and push locally.
