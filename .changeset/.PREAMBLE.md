This version of skuba should not require significant upgrade effort for most projects, but it does contain some notable changes:

- Internal linting and patching have been overhauled to streamline code generation on version upgrades.

  To make upgrades easy now and going forward, we recommend setting up [GitHub autofixes](https://seek-oss.github.io/skuba/docs/deep-dives/github.html#github-autofixes).

- New projects will now be initialised with pnpm.

  A future release of skuba may transition existing projects to pnpm.
