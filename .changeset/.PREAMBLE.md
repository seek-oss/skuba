This version of skuba looks more scary than it is. The major change is that our dependencies have bumped their minimum Node.js requirement from 18.12 to 18.18. Most SEEK projects do not pin minor Node.js versions and are unlikely to be affected by this change.

In the spirit of upgrades, we recently refreshed our [ARM64 migration guide](https://seek-oss.github.io/skuba/docs/deep-dives/arm64.html#migrating-an-existing-project) and also have [one for pnpm](https://seek-oss.github.io/skuba/docs/deep-dives/pnpm.html). A previous release landed a [`skuba migrate`](https://seek-oss.github.io/skuba/docs/cli/migrate.html) command to simplify upgrades to Node.js 20 (active LTS) before Node.js 18 reaches EOL in April 2025.
