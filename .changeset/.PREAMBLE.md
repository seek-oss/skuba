This version of skuba should not be a large upgrade effort for most use-cases, but does contains some large changes:

- Major upgrades to the linting and patching systems, which may result in some code changes on version upgrades.
  To make upgrades easy now and going forward, we recommend setting up [GitHub autofixes](https://seek-oss.github.io/skuba/docs/deep-dives/github.html#github-autofixes).
- New projects will now be initialised with `pnpm`.
  A future release of `skuba` will likely transition existing projects to `pnpm` as well.
