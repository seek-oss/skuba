skuba 9 is a reasonably large release, however we're hoping it won't be too much trouble to upgrade.

The main changes are:

- ESLint 9 and flat config migration (in which `skuba format` should handle most of the work for you)
- Swapping out `ts-node` for `tsx`
- Some fixes in Docker & Buildkite files
