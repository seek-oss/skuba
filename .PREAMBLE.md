This major release of **skuba** has a few breaking changes, all of which should be relatively easy to adapt your codebase to. Read the full release notes for details.

Key changes of this version:

- `.npmrc` settings for pnpm projects will be attempted to be automatically migrated to `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. Particular attention is needed for monorepos; read on.
- Node.js 18.x is no longer supported.
- Templates now use [simplified npm private access](https://seek-oss.github.io/skuba/docs/deep-dives/npm.html).
