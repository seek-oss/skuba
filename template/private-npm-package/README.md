To publish your module to npm and release notes to GitHub:

## Release

While a Buildkite pipeline for CI/CD is generated out of the box, there are some additional steps to get semantic-release working:

<https://github.com/SEEK-Jobs/npm-package-buildkite-pipeline#installing-on-your-repository>

### Releasing latest

Commits to the `master` branch will be released with the `latest` tag, which is the default used when running `npm install` or `yarn install`.

### Releasing other dist-tags

semantic-release prescribes a branch-based workflow for managing [distribution tags].

[distribution tags]: https://docs.npmjs.com/adding-dist-tags-to-packages

You can push to other branches to manage betas, maintenance updates to prior major versions, and more.

Here are some branches that semantic-release supports by default:

| Git branch | npm dist-tag |
| :--------- | :----------- |
| master     | latest       |
| alpha      | alpha        |
| beta       | beta         |
| next       | next         |
| 1.x        | release-1.x  |
