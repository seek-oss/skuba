## Release

This package is published to the public npm registry with a GitHub Actions [release workflow].

The workflow runs on select branches:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      # add others as necessary
      - $default-branch
      - beta
      # - alpha
```

It depends on this repo being hosted on [seek-oss] with appropriate access.

To set up this repo for publishing, follow the instructions in our [OSS npm package guidance].

### Commit messages

This package is published with **[semantic-release]**, which requires a particular commit format to manage semantic versioning.
You can run the interactive `pnpm commit` command in place of `git commit` to generate a compliant commit title and message.
If you use the `Squash and merge` option on pull requests, take extra care to format the squashed commit in the GitHub UI before merging.

### Releasing latest

Commits to the `<%- defaultBranch %>` branch will be released with the `latest` tag,
which is the default used when running `npm install` or `pnpm install`.

### Releasing other dist-tags

**[semantic-release]** prescribes a branch-based workflow for managing [distribution tags].

You can push to other branches to manage betas, maintenance updates to prior major versions, and more.

Here are some branches that **semantic-release** supports by default:

| Git branch           | npm dist-tag |
| :------------------- | :----------- |
| <%- defaultBranch %> | latest       |
| alpha                | alpha        |
| beta                 | beta         |
| next                 | next         |
| 1.x                  | release-1.x  |

For more information, see the **semantic-release** docs on [triggering a release].
