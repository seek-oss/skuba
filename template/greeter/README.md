## Design

The `greeter` template is the prototypical _hello world_ project.
It can function as a playground for the TypeScript tooling prescribed by our [technology strategy],
or serve as a starting point for a backend project if the other built-in templates are not a good fit.

It's a barebones Node.js application that comprises:

- A [src/app.ts] that can be run locally to greet the user
- A [src/app.test.ts] that demonstrates rudimentary Jest usage

## Development

### Test

```shell
yarn test
```

### Lint

```shell
# Fix issues
yarn format

# Check for issues
yarn lint
```

### Start

```shell
# Start a live-reloading process
yarn start

# Start with Node.js Inspector enabled
yarn start:debug
```

This runs a live-reloading Node.js process pointing to the [src/app.ts](src/app.ts) entrypoint.

## Deploy

The `greeter` template includes a simple [Buildkite pipeline](.buildkite/pipeline.yml) for testing and linting.
It does not assume a deployment method or environment.

For inspiration in this space, check out:

- The `koa-rest-api` template for containerised deployments
- The `lambda-sqs-worker` template for Lambda deployments
