Next steps:

1. [ ] Finish templating if this was skipped earlier:

   ```shell
   pnpm exec skuba configure
   ```

2. [ ] Create a new repository in the appropriate GitHub organisation.
3. [ ] Add the repository to BuildAgency;
       see our internal [Buildkite Docs] for more information.
4. [ ] Push local commits to the upstream GitHub branch.
5. [ ] Configure [GitHub repository settings].
6. [ ] Delete this checklist ðŸ˜Œ.

## Design

The `greeter` template is the prototypical _hello world_ project.
It can function as a playground for the TypeScript tooling prescribed by our [Technical Guidelines],
or serve as a starting point for a backend project if the other built-in templates are not a good fit.

It's a barebones Node.js application that comprises:

- A [src/app.ts](src/app.ts) that can be run locally to greet the user
- A [src/app.test.ts](src/app.test.ts) that demonstrates rudimentary Jest usage

## Development

### Test

```shell
pnpm test
```

### Lint

```shell
# Fix issues
pnpm format

# Check for issues
pnpm lint
```

### Start

```shell
# Start a live-reloading process
pnpm start

# Start with Node.js Inspector enabled
pnpm start:debug
```

This runs a live-reloading Node.js process pointing to the [src/app.ts](src/app.ts) entrypoint.

## Deploy

The `greeter` template includes a simple [Buildkite pipeline](.buildkite/pipeline.yml) for testing and linting.
It does not assume a deployment method or environment.

For inspiration in this space, check out:

- The `koa-rest-api` template for containerised deployments
- The `lambda-sqs-worker` template for Lambda deployments
